1) creating_sample_code:
--------------------------------

Till this point, I managed to create 1 sample from the csv files

of SpecCence data.

The sample is of the form: 29 x width , where width is the number of

lines in the csv files, then reshape this sample to a column vector

	- (29 x width),1
	- recall that each line represenets a widnow of 125 ms

I didn't check yet the gaps in time between each window.

To be done in the next phase.

---------------------------------------------------------------

2) adding_header_none_code:
------------------------------

Need to add header = None in case the csv file
don't have header.
